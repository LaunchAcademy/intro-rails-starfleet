# Starship Starfleet

The goal of this clinic is to do test-/error-driven development of a very basic Rails app. Tests have been provided to focus on the weekend's concepts.

If you have time (which is probable), introduce Rails forms, which they'll read about that evening. Set up a simple form to add a new starship, including the new and create actions. If time allows, talk about strong params.

- form to add new starship
- see all ship crew members on the starship show page
- form to add new member from the starship show page
